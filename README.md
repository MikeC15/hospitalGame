Game description

Mike's hospital game [name pending] is a surgery game. You will work to improve your player in order to make him a more effective surgeon and to purchase upgrades. During surgery, you will control bleeders and make decisions to keep your patient alive and finish the procedure. If your patient survives you will gain experience and money for upgrades. If the surgeon kills too many patients the game will end and progress will be erased, so keep those patients alive!
